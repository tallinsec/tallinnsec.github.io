### Who are we? What is TallinnSec?

TallinnSec is a nonprofit organization of information security professionals, practitioners and enthusiasts. We organize various meetups/events:

- to provide opportunities in order to enhance the practical knowledge
- to have a place where people can learn, present and exchange new skills
- to make a space where one time attending is our next time SPEAKER
- to grow a professional network of people just like YOU

#### Organizing power behind all of this
