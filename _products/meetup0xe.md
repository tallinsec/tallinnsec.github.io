**Speaker bio:**

<p><b>Otso Jousimaa (Ruuvi Innovations Ltd (Oy)- "Topic TBD"</b><br>
In everyday work life Otso has taken CIO role. As he says "I coordinate daily software and server infrastructure related matters." His passion in cybersecurity started as a teenager, then he shyly says that he is by no means a cybersecurity expert 🔬 In the presentation he will talk to us what it is to apply for Finnish Cybersecurity Label which is based on ETSI EN 303 645 European Cybersecurity standard for IoT devices. His presentation will be aimed at IoT device developers and managers who need to consider the security of devices they are creating. The presentation itself has a brief introduction into Ruuvi and ETSI EN 303 645 standard, after which he wants to create an open discussion about IoT device development from a security point of view.
